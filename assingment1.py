# # # Task 1: Create a Poem using Comments
# # # Craft a short poem about Python. 
# # # Each line of the poem should be a single-line comment.

#In forests deep, where shadows weave,
#Python slithers, silent eve.
#Its scales a dance, a rhythmic glide,
#In nature's code, it doth confide.

# # #Task 2: Multi-line Poem
# # #Now, craft a multi-line poem about Python. 
# # #Instead of using single-line comments, 
# # #use triple quotes to make it a multi-line comment. Here's an example:
'''
In the jungle of code, where whispers flow,
Python reigns, silent yet aglow.
With power unmatched, its prowess clear,
In lines of code, its dominance peers.
In syntax wild, its elegance gleams,
'''

# # # Task 3: Combining Single and Multi-line Comments
# # #Choose one line from your single-line comment poem and another line from your multi-line comment poem. Put these lines into a new Python script and separate them with a descriptive single-line comment about each.

# # #For instance:

# This line is from my first poem
#In nature's code, it doth confide.

# This line is from my multi-line poem
'''

# # #Task 1: Code Correction
# # #You have been given a piece of code with several variable and constant names that don't follow the Python naming convention.

# # #userAge = 25

# # #MAXLIMIT = 1000

# # #Python Data Types and type() Function
# # #Objective:
# # #The aim of this assignment is to practice identifying and using Python's basic data types, as well as the type() function for checking a variable's data type.

# # #Task 1: Code Correction
# # #Given below are some variable assignments. Your task is to identify the data type of each variable and then use the type() function to print it out:

variable_a = "Hello, World!"
variable_b = 23
variable_c = 3.14
variable_d = True
print(type(variable_a))
print(type(variable_b))
print(type(variable_c))

# # # Task 1: Code Correction
# # # Below is a piece of code where a variable's data type changes. 
# # # Your task is to print the type of the variable after each assignment to see the dynamic nature in action:

# # # Calculate the total cost of three items you'd commonly find in a grocery store,
# # # given their individual prices.
